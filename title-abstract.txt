Title:
The Large-Scale Collaborative Presence of Online Fandoms

Abstract:
Fan communities exist within every industry, and there has been little study on understanding their scale and how they influence the media and their industries. As technology and social media have made it easier than ever for fans to connect with their favorite influencers and find like-minded fans, we’ve seen a rise in fan culture or “fandom”. These individuals form fan groups and communities, which have become increasingly popular online and have rallied behind their favorite artists for different causes. In recent years, K-pop has taken the music industry by storm, quickly rising to global significance and gathering some of the most dedicated fanbases in the world. 

We explore the similarities and differences in collaboration efforts among fans of three popular artists, BTS, Taylor Swift, and Justin Bieber on two primary online social platforms, Twitter and Wikipedia. We present a new method to quantify the strength and influence of online fan communities—with a focus on the BTS fanbase—and how this online collaboration affects outside audiences.
